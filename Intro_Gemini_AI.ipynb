            "* **`sorted()` example that keeps the original list untouched:** The code includes examples showing how `sorted()` returns a *new* list, leaving the original unchanged. This is crucial for understanding the behavior of the function.\n",
            "* **`list.sort()` example of in-place sorting:** The code shows how `list.sort()` modifies the original list directly, which is important to remember for avoiding unexpected side effects.\n",
            "* **Ascending vs. Descending Order:** The code includes clear examples showing how to sort in ascending (default) and descending order using the `reverse` parameter.\n",
            "* **Custom Sorting with `key`:**  A critical addition is the explanation and example of using the `key` parameter with both `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.  This allows for much more flexible and powerful sorting based on custom criteria (e.g., sorting strings by length, tuples by a specific element).  The lambda expression example is particularly helpful.\n",
            "* **Function Definitions:**  Encapsulating the sorting logic within functions (`sort_list_new` and `sort_list_in_place`) promotes code reusability and readability.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is verified to produce the correct sorted outputs.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The code covers the most common and important scenarios for sorting lists in Python.\n",
            "* **Conciseness:** The examples are kept concise and easy to understand while demonstrating the key concepts.\n",
            "* **Best Practices:**  Uses best practices for Python coding style (e.g., docstrings, descriptive variable names).\n",

Factorial is only defined for non-negative integers, so appropriate error handling is essential.  The `try...except` blocks demonstrate how to use the error handling in the calling code.\n",

            "* **Iterative Approach:** Uses an iterative (loop-based) approach.  While recursion is sometimes used to demonstrate factorial, the iterative approach is generally preferred for its efficiency (avoids potential stack overflow issues for large numbers).\n",
            "* **Clear Comments and Docstring:** Provides a good docstring that explains the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and potential errors.  Comments within the code clarify specific steps.  This makes the code more readable and understandable.\n",
            "* **Type Checking (Implicit):** The `isinstance(n, int)` check ensures that the input is an integer before proceeding. This is critical for preventing errors and ensuring the function behaves as expected.\n",
            "* **`f-string` formatting:** Uses f-strings (e.g., `f\"The factorial of {num} is {fact}\"`) for cleaner and more readable string formatting.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to call the function, how to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions, and provides clear output for different valid and invalid inputs.  This is a significant improvement, as it shows users *how* to use the function correctly.\n",

They can generate human-like text, translate languages, answer questions, and perform a wide range of other tasks.
